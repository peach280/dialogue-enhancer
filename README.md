# ðŸ§  Smart Dialogue Enhancer

A mini AI-powered tool that rewrites user dialogue into different tones like **Friendly**, **Romantic**, or **Funny** â€” designed to help creators of visual novels and interactive stories write expressive, tone-matching dialogue faster.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation

This project was built as a creative prototype inspired by [RouteVN](https://routevn.com), a platform for visual novel creation. Writing dialogue that resonates with the story's tone is often hard, and this tool aims to enhance that process using AI.
